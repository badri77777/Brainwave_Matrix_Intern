Password Strength Checker Project
This project provides a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users. The program evaluates passwords based on multiple criteria, including length, complexity, and uniqueness, and provides feedback to the user regarding their password's strength.

Features
Length Analysis: Checks if the password meets the minimum length requirement.
Complexity Analysis: Evaluates the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Uniqueness Check: Flags commonly used or weak passwords.
Feedback System: Offers real-time suggestions for improving password strength.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Password_Strength_Checker.git
cd Password_Strength_Checker
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the script to analyze passwords:

bash
Copy code
python password_strength_checker.py
Example Input and Output:

plaintext
Copy code
Enter a password to check its strength: P@ssw0rd123!
Password Strength: Strong
Suggestions: Your password is strong, but adding more unique characters would make it even better.
Algorithm Details
The tool analyzes passwords based on the following criteria:

Length: Minimum recommended length is 12 characters.
Character Diversity:
At least one uppercase letter.
At least one lowercase letter.
At least one number.
At least one special character (!@#$%^&*()_+=-[]{}|;:'",.<>?/).
Uniqueness: Compares against a list of weak or commonly used passwords.
Feedback System: Provides actionable feedback on how to improve the password.
Testing
To ensure the tool works as expected, run the included unit tests:


pytest tests/test_password_checker.py
Future Enhancements
Add a database of leaked passwords for enhanced uniqueness checks.
Integrate with web applications for real-time password strength validation.
Implement multilingual feedback.
